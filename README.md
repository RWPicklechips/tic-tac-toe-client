this Game is legendary, brace yourself for the Game. you are not ready, and you are not worthy of the Game.

I wrote this application in javascript with some html and a lil css. I used atom as a text editor and npm as a package manager

I started this project with the user API because it was what I felt the most comfortable at the time. I moved onto the HTML after in order to have something tangiable to work with. After that it was a matter of filling in JS functions where they were needed and I capped it off with the game API and polishing the UI

Hopefully in the future I'll learn enough CSS to be able to keep the game board from stretching over the new game and stats button on the first mark. I'm also planning to tuck the new password and maybe the sign out functions behind an account button to clear the user's page, I think it looks a little hectic with all those buttons stacked on top of each other. Also I'd love to add a multiplayer function.

User Stories:
As a brand new user, I want to be able to sign up so I can play the game.
As a non-logged-in user, I want to sign in so that I have access to the game.
As a logged-in user, I want to sign out so that I can secure my status.
As a logged-in user, I want to be able to change my password if I want.
As a logged-in user, I want to navigate the page so that I can know how many games I won.
